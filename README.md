# DL_NeuronAnnotation
Here is the code used to conduct research on neural pathway tracing through SEM zebrafish larvae data. This code was used in the papers "Understanding Neural Pathways in Zebrafish through Deep Learning and High Resolution Electron Microscope Data" and "A Simplified Approach to Deep Learning for Image Segmentation".
